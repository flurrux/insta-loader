# about  

a chrome extension to quickly download any media from [https://instagram.com/](instagram.com)  

# features  

- download-buttons on mainfeed, stories, userpages and generally any kind of feeds like tags or locations  
- jump to lower/upper post on the mainfeed by `w` (upper post) or `s` (lower post)  
- navigate left/right on carousels (with multiple pictures/videos) and in stories via the `d` (navigate right) and `a` (navigate left) keys.  
- on the mainfeed or in stories, the enter-key can be pressed to trigger downloads


downloaded videos/images will be saved in `Downloads/[username]`.  
so for example if you download an image from [instagram.com/beeple_crap](https://www.instagram.com/beeple_crap/), it will be placed in `Downloads/beeple_crap/`
