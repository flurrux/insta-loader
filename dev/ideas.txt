- update readme
- add /dist to git
- shortcut for disk-download
- show if an image is already saved
- button to open folder of model
- button to jump to saved image
- show download queue in the corner and how many where sucessfull/failed.
maybe just showing the queue and how many failed is enough. also persist the failed links 
so they are shown again after reload. when there are multiple windows of instagram, there should 
be only one queue-instance.
- progress-bar on profile-page when scrolling down
- download entire profile - button
- download entire story - button
- story mode: always pause at start - option, pause when downloading - option
- story mode: open tagged persons in new tab
- auto-download mode where every post/story is downloaded automatically as long as chrome is running
- automatic testing if everything still works, make a page where every step is visible and described in detail,
for example show a feed and pick a random item, then detect the button-bar and highlight it
- sort stories by relevance
- profile page: sometimes there are too many pictures to download in one sitting,
so remember the last seen post and continue later.
- options: enable prompt download, enable native download, only show icons on hover
- include posts of public profiles that you are not following in the feed (to prevent getting banned)
- create a new view for fast story watching. maybe it could look like a grid with about 20 items in the 
viewport and i can quickly decide which ones i want to download. it could have like rows where each row
is the story of a person.
- automatic expansion of collections


bugs: ###

- scrolling of story-bar is now janky, maybe because of the mutation-observers for
persistence and navigation
- bug: when dark-reader is enabled, the download-icons are not visible, except the success one
- bug: in a collection when an item is downloaded, the success icon appears, then the next-arrow 
is clicked and the next slide is shown which might not be downloaded, but the success icon remains.
this happens because the icons are not updated when another slide is shown.
the same happens when a post is opened in an overlay, and then the "next"-button is pressed
- issue: instagram profiles can change their name and still be the same url. in that case, 
there can be two download-folders for the same profile. is this good or bad behaviour?
